            <p>A straight line in space that starts from one point to another is known as a vector, this tells us that it has direction and magnitude. Furthermore, vectors in physics have a function to express, in this case vector magnitudes.</p>
            <p>Vectors are represented graphically like an arrow. Likewise, when they must be expressed in a formula, they are represented by an arrow over a letter.</p>

            <h2>Parts of a vector<hr></h2>
            <ul class="list-text">
                <li>The <strong>direction</strong> of the vector is the angle formed by the line that contains it with the abscissa axis (horizontal axis).</li>
                <li><strong>Vector magnitudes</strong> are those magnitudes that, in addition to being represented by a number and a unit, also need to be expressed in space with a direction and a sense, that is, with a vector. This distinguishes them from <strong>scalar quantities</strong>, which only require a number and a unit.</li>
                <li>Direction is also where the arrow points (north, east, west...). In Spanish is called <strong>"sentido"</strong>.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Product point<hr></h2>
            <p>The dot product is a way to combine two vectors. Intuitively, it tells us something about how far two vectors point in the same direction. The dot product of two vectors results in a scalar number.</p>
            <p>Example: Having the vectors U = (X1, Y1, Z1) and V = (X2, Y2, Z2).</p>
            <p>The dot product is U*V and would be equal to = X1.X2 + Y1. Y2 + Z1. Z2 = K.</p>
            <p>K is the scalar resulting from the multiplication of the vectors. That is, the dot product is the sum of the measurements multiplied by their respective vectors.</p>
            <h2>Magnitude<hr></h2>
            <p>The magnitude of a vector <SPAN STYLE="text-decoration:overline">PQ</SPAN> is the distance between the initial point P and the final point Q.</p>
            <p>If the coordinates of the start point and end point of a vector are given, the distance formula can be used to find its magnitude.</p>
            <img src="./img/imgVector2.png" alt="magnitude ecuation">
            <p>You can calculate the magnitude of a vector entering the vector's values with this:</p>
            <form>
                <input type="text" name="vector" placeholder="1,4,6..." id="text_vector1"><input type="button" value="Go!" id="magnitudebutton">       
            </form>
            <p>Result: <output id="imprimir"></output></p>
            <h2>Direction<hr></h2>
            <p>The direction of a vector is the measure of the angle that makes with a horizontal line. This is one of the formulas:</p>
            <img src="./img/imgVector3.png" alt="angle formula">
            <p>x is the horizontal change and y is the vertical change.</p>
            <p>You can calculate the direction of a vector that have two inputs entering the vector's values with this:</p>
            <form>
                <input type="text" name="vector" placeholder="ex: 1,4" id="text_vector2"><input type="button" value="Go!" id="directionbutton">       
            </form>
            <p>Result in degrees: <output id="imprimir2"></output></p>
