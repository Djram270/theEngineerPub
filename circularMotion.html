                <h2>Formulas<hr></h2>
                <p>With the formula:</p>
                <img src="./img/ec1.png" alt="Ecuation 1">
                <p>Considering (r) as a vector, it can be written in terms of the rectangular unit vectors i and j like this:</p>
                <img src="./img/ec2.png" alt="Ecuation 2">
                <p>Substituting the formula would be:</p>
                <img src="./img/ec3.png" alt="Ecuation 3">
                <p>The <strong>velocity vector</strong> is obtained by taking the derivative of the position vector with respect to time:</p>
                <img src="./img/ec4.png" alt="Ecuation 4">
                <p>Taking the derivative of velocity with respect to time, we will obtain the <strong>acceleration</strong> that describes a circular path.</p>
                <img src="./img/ec5.png" alt="Ecuation 5">
                <p>Finally, the components of the position, velocity, and acceleration vectors can be written as:</p>

                <h2>Some facts to keep in mind <hr></h2>
                <ul class="list-text">
                    <li>The speed is called tangential speed and is simply represented by the letter (v) and indicates the arc length that the object travels per unit of time.<br></li>
                    <li>Tangential velocity is represented by the letter v with a little arrow above, that little arrow above tells us that it is a vector magnitude and to define a vector magnitude we need to know its module, but also its direction.</li>
                    <li>Direction is where the tangential velocity is oriented.</li>
                    <li>The tangential speed is the magnitude of the tangential velocity.</li>
                    <li>The centripetal acceleration points toward the center.</li>
                    <li>Angular speed is represented by the Greek letter Omega (w) and tells us the angle that which the radius of gyration sweeps per unit of time.</li>
                    <li>We can write the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration in terms of the magnitude of the tangential velocity and the radius of the circle described as follows:</li>
                    <img src="./img/ec7.png" alt="Ecuation 7">
                    <li>If we use the relations between the angular displacement, the angular velocity and the time we will have:</li>
